# SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE MONITORING AND TRACKING SOFTWARE
## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT

When working within IB, most of my daily headaches were waiting on files from the originator and public side of the bank. 
There is sometimes a large time-delay for getting the files into the private side. Assuming the files are for the correct
pool and information is up-to-date, the analyst will have to manually parse these file for necessary 

The files are mainly Excel files with multiple sheets that vary based on the originator. These worksheets contain 
time-series data that have metrics specific to the asset pool. Tha analyst would spend the bulk of their time update internal 
Excel files that monitor the specific pool and asset class. In addition, the analyst will have to refer to previous
quarterly, semi-annual, or annual reviews (more Excel files and Powerpoints) to track the changes.

The complexity and time-waste of tracking a specific pool comes from the multiple calculations for the same metrics, poor
documentation, and finding the raw source data. In my limited experience, poor documentation and asking/finding 
the previous person that covered the name is the most frustrating time sink of the role.

### 1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

#### Originator storing and reporting of data

Data is stored in an Excel workbook that is highly unstructured and difficult to parse. Each workbook usually contains
the assets within the pool and reported metrics. As the pool changes, the changes should be easy to track and report. 
This problem is amplified when the pool is revolving.
